# MxsxllBox VM

## Overview

MxsxllBox is a custom virtual machine (VM) designed with a 64 KB memory space divided into several segments, supporting a simple instruction set and features like labels, branching, function calls, and dynamic memory management.\
It has 32 Registers 18 general purpose, 6 Registers for syscalls, 6 for the Scheduler and 1 for an interrupt

## Instructions and Parsing

- Instructions vary in size, mostly 3 or 5 bytes
- Labels support for jumps and calls, with addresses resolved in two passes
- Opcodes for arithmetic, load/store, jumps, calls, push/pop, print, and halt
- Support for string-related instructions and memory operations 

---

## Dynamic Memory Allocation

- Heap size: 16 KB
- writeable Heap size: 14 KB
- Uses a **bitmap allocator** with block size of 16 bytes
- Metadata stored in the first word of an allocation block
- `alloc` requests block counts (multiples of 16 bytes)
- `free` returns blocks to the heap
- Bitmap is stored at the beginning of Heap after the tasks


## Std. Lib. 

- Labels that are saved into the library Region of the Program Space
- ProgramStdLibStart = 0x0C01 
- ProgramEnd         = 0x0FFF
- In Syscalls O1 is always the return addr if there's only 1 return value

### String functions

- `_strcpy` copies a String to O1 from O2
- `_strlen` Loads len(O2) into O1
- `_strcmp` compares two strings sets 0 flag if they are equal carry-flag if a byte is higher
- `_strcat` concacts two strings O1 = O1+O2 `"a", "b" = "ab"`

### Utility funtctions

- `_memset` sets a region of memory(lenght O3) starting at addr(O1) to val(O2)
- `_memcpy` copies from addr(O1) to addr(O2) for ammount(O3) bytes 

### sys functions

- `_alloc` allocates ammount(O2) blocks(16 B) the start is returned in O1
- `_free` frees a block of memory O1 is the start of that Memory 


### math functions

- basic arithmetic:
  - `_add`/`_sub`/`_mul`/`_div`/`_mod`/`_inc`/`_dec`
- `_max` returns the larger val of O1/O2 in O1
- `_min` return the smaller val of O1/O2 in O1
- `_pow` returns O1**O2 in O1
- `_clamp` if Val(O2) is between two values(low O1, high O3) the 0 flag is set

### io functions

- `_printstr` prints a string from O2 is also in instruction set
- `_printchar` prints a char from O2 O1 contains char
- `_readchar` reads a char from the Keyboard Buffer into O1

---

## Keyboard Buffer

- The Keyboard-buffer is a [ring buffer]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer") N = 30
- It's write ptr is at 0x0C000 the read prt is at 0x0C001

## Custom Binary

- A custom Binary set for the linker 
- Contains code, Symbol, Relocation- lenghts under "MXOB" header
- Globals are identified as labels with an underscore

## Scheduler

- 9 Task slots
- `_spawn` creates task at addr(O1)
- `_yield` willingly gives up control
- `_init_scheduler` gives control to the scheduler only used once at the beginning

> To avoid a single  action like redrawing the screen | reading the keyboard-buffer "hogging" all resources \
> the scheduler can save the current context/state of the vm meaning(regs, PC, SP and flags) to memory.\
> To then give another Task the oportunity to continue. \
> This can occur with the help of `_yield` which willingly gives up control,\
> a code can be moved into O2(see `Yield Table`) this code confirms if the task is IO,\
> for example Keyboard blocke(waiting on input) or smth else code 1 is ready,\
> meaning that it can be chosen again if no other task is currently available.\
> The other possibility for changing the current task is an `interrupt`.\
> Either IO | hardware timer these are forced and interrupt the program wherever it is at the moment.\
> A task is created by first moving its addr into O1 using `MOVA REG LBL` and then calling `_spawn`\
> After creating all tasks control can be given to the scheduler by calling `_init_scheduler`.\
> The scheduler will start with the last task added and work it's way down before returning to the last.\

### Yield Table

| Code | description                                            |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | `running`(only internal)                               |
| 1    | `ready`(is ready)                                      |
| 2    | `keyboard-blocked` (is set to ready after input)       |
| 3    | `timer/blocked` (waiting on the next timer interrupt   |
| 4    | `unused`                                               |
| 5    | `unused`                                               |
| 6    | `unused`                                               |
| 7    | `terminated` (the tasks isn't supposed to run anymore) |

## Debugger

- opens a window where a decompiled version of the script is shown
- the currently active line is highlighted
- Step mode: progress forward with right arrow key
- Run mode: Runs until mode is switched back to step, or it hits a breakpoint
- Breakpoints can be set by left-clicking on any line
- When jumping to lbls the debugger jmps to the first line with actual content
- Set a break point there and not on the lbl name
- Any Lbls that aren't jmped, called etc. to can't be decompiled
- Regs, Pc and Stack-Top are visible on the right side of the screen

## Design Decisions

- Memory layout optimized for simplicity and performance
- Labels aren't assembled into byte code 
- The pre-Assembled code is outputted in a .obj file
- The .obj file is then linked together with other .obj files into a  final .bin file
- _The linker is given a `map[string]int` that contains [.obj filepaths] location
- Heap allocator uses first-fit policy for simplicity and speed

## Current Status

- VM running with working jumps, calls, arithmetic
- RET instruction fixed to correctly return from calls
- String Support lenght based indexing
- String functions like `_strcpy`
- Basic Memory functions like `_memset`
- Bitmap allocator
- Custom Binary Format 
- Keyboard input handling via circular buffer
- Planning to add:
    - Visual Output
    - File system
    - custom mini tcp/ip stack
